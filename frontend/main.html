                The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a frequently-employed lazy learning texhnique
                used in machine learning in both classification and regression applications. The algorithm works
                by calculating the Euclidean distance between all data points in the model and the point of interest.
                The algorithm then makes a decision based on which data the point is closest to. K is the number of 
                neighbors the point is tested against (i.e. if K=3, then the point of interest is compared to its three 
                closest neighbors). The point is "most-similar" to the data with the highest mode in those k neighbors.<br> 
                In this application, the user defines the values for the point of interest. The inputs are then used 
                to create a new object which is tested against the known dataset. The first dataset is the Iris classification 
                set which uses four attributes to sort irises into 1 of 3 classes. The second is a dataset of white wines 
                which determines the quality of the wine (0: very bad to 10: very excellent) based on 11 variables. The 
                former employs a simple classification model, while the latter is employed as a regression model.
